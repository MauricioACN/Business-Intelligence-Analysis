## 📊 Dataset Description

The synthetic dataset simulates an e-commerce system with the following interconnected tables:

- **Customers** (CustomerID, Name, Email, JoinDate)
- **Products** (ProductID, ProductName, Category, Price)
- **Stores** (StoreID, StoreName, Region)
- **Orders** (OrderID, OrderDate, CustomerID, StoreID, TotalAmount, PaymentMethod)
- **OrderItems** (OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, UnitPrice)

## 🚀 Features

- **Realistic synthetic data**: Uses Faker library to generate authentic-looking customer names, emails, dates, and business data
- **Coherent relationships**: Tables maintain logical relationships (e.g., order dates after customer registration dates)
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Includes multiple product categories, US regional data, and various payment methods
- **Scalable generation**: Easily configurable data volumes through simple parameter adjustments
- **Detailed analytics**: Built-in analysis scripts provide immediate insights into generated datasets
- **Organized structure**: Clean folder organization separating data, scripts, and future SQL operations

## 📋 Requirements

```bash
pip install faker pandas
```

Or using the requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔧 Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Business-Intelligence-Analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Generate synthetic data**
   ```bash
   python python/generate_synthetic_data.py
   ```

4. **Analyze the generated data**
   ```bash
   python python/analyze_data.py
   ```

## 📁 Generated Dataset

After running the generation script, you'll find the following CSV files in the `/data` folder:

| File | Records | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `customers.csv` | 1,000 | Customer profiles with demographics |
| `products.csv` | 200 | Product catalog across 10 categories |
| `stores.csv` | 25 | Store locations across US states |
| `orders.csv` | 2,500 | Order transactions with totals |
| `order_items.csv` | ~11,000 | Individual line items per order |

## 📈 Customization

You can modify the following variables in `python/generate_synthetic_data.py` to adjust data quantities:

```python
NUM_CUSTOMERS = 1000      # Number of customers
NUM_PRODUCTS = 200        # Number of products
NUM_STORES = 25          # Number of stores
NUM_ORDERS = 2500        # Number of orders
MAX_ITEMS_PER_ORDER = 8  # Maximum items per order
```

## 🎯 Use Cases
